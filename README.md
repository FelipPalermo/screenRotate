this works only on windows : 
  first of all, you need to decide where your pyw file will stay forever
  copy the pyw path and change the content in the "SR_Startup" for the path
  win + r : "shell:startup"
  drop the  "SR_Startup" in this folder, and it`s done 
  every time you turn on your pc the pyw will start too
